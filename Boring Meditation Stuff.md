### Postcard Bravado

Eventually, you must meditate continuously  
infusing every moment with clear comprehension.  
And so intensive retreats are offered    
to saturate the mind with this 24/7 awareness.  
You sit in a silent cell for weeks, months and even years at a stretch

to etch this or that technique onto the mind  
ensuring your eventual liberation.  
But to depend on the twin catapults  
 of isolation and duration  
to propel your awareness into the astral realms is folly  
for you will invariably fall from grace.  
Without the crutches of silence and enforced asceticism,  
you will ﬁnd yourself still jostled by the vicissitudes of life.   
You have become a good retreatant  
 more than a good meditator.  
Sitting continuously for months in a Tibetan cave is postcard bravado

if you cannot meditate here, now, on the Flatbush Avenue bus.  
Retreat from anger, from fear, from greed,  
from hatred, from jealousy, from sloth,  
but not from life.  
The silence we need resides not in our cave but in our mind.

### The Crown

- judgment of others vs. reflection on oneself
- reflection is still intellectual, and therefore still _external_

### The Cabin


I come to this cabin, in part, to forage for universal truths. The forest is a sympathetic environment for that kind of experiment. Turn off your phone and there is no news, no email, no traffic, no music. Turn off the lights, close your eyes, watch your breath. There are no mantras, no gongs, no podcasts. Not even so much as the white noise of a refrigerator. But there is still noise.

The noise of meditation is internal. Turning off the screaming cacophony of the outside world for a few days inevitably leads you to realize your brain was screaming along with the news and the music. Now it screams alone, rocketing from one topic to another -- furious one moment, delirious the next -- in search of entertainment. We know our senses tell us lies. We can't quite see infrared light and we can't feel the gallbladder even if we are quite certain it's there. But it's always shocking to listen to the absurd lies the mind tells _itself._

Such navel-gazing isn't necessary to know that everyone is hallucinating their conscious reality. Science alone tells us this much.
