### Postcard Bravado

Eventually, you must meditate continuously  
infusing every moment with clear comprehension.  
And so intensive retreats are offered    
to saturate the mind with this 24/7 awareness.  
You sit in a silent cell for weeks, months and even years at a stretch

to etch this or that technique onto the mind  
ensuring your eventual liberation.  
But to depend on the twin catapults  
 of isolation and duration  
to propel your awareness into the astral realms is folly  
for you will invariably fall from grace.  
Without the crutches of silence and enforced asceticism,  
you will ﬁnd yourself still jostled by the vicissitudes of life.   
You have become a good retreatant  
 more than a good meditator.  
Sitting continuously for months in a Tibetan cave is postcard bravado

if you cannot meditate here, now, on the Flatbush Avenue bus.  
Retreat from anger, from fear, from greed,  
from hatred, from jealousy, from sloth,  
but not from life.  
The silence we need resides not in our cave but in our mind.

### The Crown

- judgment of others vs. reflection on oneself
- reflection is still intellectual, and therefore still _external_
