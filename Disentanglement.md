# (Four Provinces of) Disentanglement

## Time

- _Anapana For Clojurists_ = make time real
- Crux as a tool for bitemporal understanding
- like gravity, a force that permeates everything 

## Data

- data is where users touch the system
- production dbs always contain broken data
- users >> developers, which implies data >> code
- data-oriented design => crux implementation, vector, arrow, etc.
- data ownership = data privacy ... essential for businesses, even though few realize it yet
- GDPR / eviction = weak data ownership (the law must suffice)

## Form

- if changes to schema are expensive, people simply don't make the changes
- API schema, db schema => high-value places to enable power and agility, since they are seen as expensive (slow) now
- paper "forms"
- inFORMation = data which has graduated to a position of semantic meaning for humans
- self-describing vs. context: W3C vs. RelaxNG
- Graph DBs ~= HyperCard ~= Crux ~= Web

## Code 

[[Code xtdb]]

- code is where developers touch the system
- mainframe => client/server => HTTP => Crux+Site+desktop/JS/clients
- user-serviceable = Right To Repair = move code around instead of moving data around external silos ~= F/OSS
