# data: across time (xtdb)

- [ ] revisit “on truth”

“database” … what is meant by this? we almost named xtdb “zeitbase”

data = datum in plural, which must be “across” time

there is only now / harris — truth and practical approximations of truth

just as an author’s work will be misunderstood as soon as it is read, the creators of systems will have their systems misunderstood and misapplied, whether social (the prince, karl marx) or technical (postgres, kafka). the creator cannot prevent this but only create so the reader of their work or implementer of their system at least remains within some guidelines. the general utility of the system also has a category of applicability based on how consciously the creator anticipates the system’s abuse. see: site / client libs / core1 v core2
