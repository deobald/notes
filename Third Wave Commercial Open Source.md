## Preppers, DIY, Off-Grid

Although 3COS adheres more closely to the ideals of "Free Software"
(Stallmanism/ist), the old guard of f/oss tends to resemble the
prepper / off-gridder community in the 2020s. There is a 90s image
of hackers with hand-soldered hardware piled on stacks of books with
wires loosely hanging everywhere which clashes with the winning
waves / trends from above (design, simplicity).

RTR does not imply DIY. The best example of this so far might be
Framework, since they offer both prebuilt and DIY options, but I
personally hope they start leaning away from DIY in their marketing.
People want an it-just-works, out-of-the-box experience. I know
I certainly do.

SaaS, similarly, lends itself to an it-just-works experience. Click
a button, the software is not only "on", but it's instantly connected
and integrated. This is also a beautiful business model when the code
isn't artificially hidden. Open source SaaS is inherently RTR. The
common term here is "self-hosting", but it should really be
"self-hostABLE", where the vast majority of people don't really want
to maintain their own servers... but want to know they could (or
could pay someone to) if they so choose.

As of Q2 2023, the current craze in self-hosting is Mastodon, but this
will quickly fade (it may have faded by the time you read this), as
running a Mastodon server entails two huge efforts: (1) maintain the
server, as you would any other, including a potentially large amount
of traffic and (2) socially manage what is, in effect, an open-ended
BBS. As of this writing, this is already proving way too much for most
server maintainers.
