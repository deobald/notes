# data: across time (xtdb)

- [ ] revisit “on truth”

“database” … what is meant by this? we almost named xtdb “zeitbase”

data = datum in plural, which must be “across” time

there is only now / harris — truth and practical approximations of truth

just as an author’s work will be misunderstood as soon as it is read, the creators of systems will have their systems misunderstood and misapplied, whether social (the prince, karl marx) or technical (postgres, kafka). the creator cannot prevent this but only create so the reader of their work or implementer of their system at least remains within some guidelines. the general utility of the system also has a category of applicability based on how consciously the creator anticipates the system’s abuse. see: site / client libs / core1 v core2

“let the record show!” - lawyer voice
what record?

things with sustainable processes survive, but so do things with _peristence_. just because something is on disk doesn’t mean it’s on disk forever. this is part of the appeal of dlts, immutable records. not only is an immutable easier to reason about (functionally) it’s much more likely to still be here in 20 years.

…data is an INDUSTRY

granularity / resolution of truth:
time = chronon
space = record - size, shape, form 

ex: “like” a post = did the user really LIKE it? what were they actually feeling? heart rate data? EEG? fmri?


## read vs write confusion

- event-driven vs event-sourced
- open source is not “anyone can contribute”
- an open university is not “anyone can declare the syllabus”

## unbundled

an event stream is “unbundled” in much the same way the original macintosh was. woz had a vision for _hackers_ but, as it turns out, hackers want black boxes they can open… not unbundled boxes that arrive some assembly required in the mail
