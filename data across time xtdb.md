# data: across time (xtdb)

- [ ] revisit “on truth”

“database” … what is meant by this? we almost named xtdb “zeitbase”

data = datum in plural, which must be “across” time

there is only now / harris — truth and practical approximations of truth

just as an author’s work will be misunderstood as soon as it is read, the creators of systems will have their systems misunderstood and misapplied, whether social (the prince, karl marx) or technical (postgres, kafka). the creator cannot prevent this but only create so the reader of their work or implementer of their system at least remains within some guidelines. the general utility of the system also has a category of applicability based on how consciously the creator anticipates the system’s abuse. see: site / client libs / core1 v core2

what record?

things with sustainable processes survive, but so do things with _peristence_. just because something is on disk doesn’t mean it’s on disk forever. this is part of the appeal of dlts, immutable records. not only is an immutable easier to reason about (functionally) it’s much more likely to still be here in 20 years.

alex: “you’re throwing away your DATA?! you’re throwing away gold!!”

if (truth in) data is reified imagination then perhaps knowledge is reified thought. we collectively agree that something is true and encode that cooperative truth as data. that data becomes _knowledge_ when we apply thought to it, adding the thought to our collective imagination.
