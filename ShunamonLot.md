# ShunamonLot

- letter written in a style where I assume I may miss the opportunity to speak to you in person... apologies if the opportunity was NOT missed and you are reading this letter anyway
- first off, apologies for troubling you
- secondly, two agenda items: (1) present offer to buy your lot and (2) ongoing offer to buy, should you ever be interested in selling
- why: neighbour (10 years), would like to avoid residential lots nearby as all of the surrounding lots (Caseys, Sandy) are used exclusively for camping
- desire: to keep the lots natural forest lots... not to develop them, build roads, subdivide, or otherwise damage the natural surroundings.
- I am currently willing to offer X, as nearby forest lots sell for Y
- I am happy to speak about what you consider a fair price
- I am happy to keep the conversation going, indefinitely, as I will always be interested in buying this lot to keep it as natural forest.
