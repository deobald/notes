# Buckets and Pipes

"Trucks and Tubes and Truth"

- natural gas lines vs. propane tanks
- sewage vs. composting toilet
- “not a truck… series of tubes”
- all-at-once (truck, db) vs. continuum or replaying all events (pipe, kafka)
- particles and waves - p are easier to understand

can’t just get all water out of a pipe - you have to take whatever is coming out of the tap.

no country has rice delivery pipes no matter how much rice a household eats.

one may imagine totally new uses of existing technology but it takes a small leap of novelty once in a while to imagine entirely new technologies altogether

SoSaC = samus aran space vault … not now, but very near future
