# Buckets and Pipes

"Trucks and Tubes and Truth"

- natural gas lines vs. propane tanks
- sewage vs. composting toilet
- “not a truck… series of tubes”
- all-at-once (truck, db) vs. continuum or replaying all events (pipe, kafka)
- particles and waves - p are easier to understand

can’t just get all water out of a pipe - you have to take whatever is coming out of the tap.
