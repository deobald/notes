# Forest for the Trees

i remember as a child sitting on the curb outside my house, starting at a rock i had picked from the asfalt. i wondered what was the significance of this rock and, though i had never heard the question which begins “if a tree falls in a forest…”, i wondered if the rock really existed if no one was paying attention to it or caring about it. i felt sad for the rock when it was in this non-existent state.

it seems unproductive to think of roads in terms of individual stones as it is to measure miles of beach by counting grains of sand, yet it’s not obvious what the correct “zoom level” should be. one street? the idea of the street? principles by which streets should be laid? as humanity trudges forward, it feels as though we are staring ever more closely at the stones in the street and forgetting what the streets were built for in the first place.
