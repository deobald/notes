# AIGPL-4.0 - The End of Open Source

Affero Incognosco GPL

When the training data for something like Copilot must be licensed a certain way,
the AIGPL-4.0 would cause consumption to force an AIGPL-4.0 license on the consumer?
(licensing training data)

- license code, models, and training data? (separately?)

- hippocratic license is obviously silly
- RAIL isn’t seen as being so silly, even though it is equivalently absurd in its attempt to police users’ behaviour
- google leaked memo: “we have no moat”
- open source is coming anyway; might as well have a license for it

- AGPL shares over networks and this seems like a desireable property for copyleft AI licenses but maybe the IGPL-4.0 would also exist that

## Excalibur / Master Sword

For some reason, recently IP lawyers occasionally advocate for the idea that the software license is some sort of magic weapon that can prevent crimes that the actual criminal justice system cannot.

If I'm attacked on the street, I do not run to a copyright lawyer.

## Carte Blanche (vs. Magic Weapon)

Conversely, a license has no power to supercede antitrust laws.
It seems very likely that, within the decade, we'll see antitrust laws emerge which prevent a _platform_ vendor from operating a service competing directly with SaaS running on their platform, regardless of whether it is open source or not.
