# AIGPL-4.0 - The End of Open Source

Affero Incognosco GPL

When the training data for something like Copilot must be licensed a certain way, the AIGPL-4.0 would cause consumption to force an AIGPL-4.0 license on the consumer? (licensing training data)

- license code, models, and training data? (separately?)

- hippocratic license is obviously silly
- RAIL isn’t seen as being so silly, even though it is equivalently absurd in its attempt to police users’ behaviour 
- google leaked memo: “we have no moat”
- open source is coming anyway; might as well have a license for it 

- AGPL shares over networks and this seems like a desireable property for copyleft AI licenses but maybe the IGPL-4.0 would also exist that
