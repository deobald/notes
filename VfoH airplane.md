## intellectualize it 

most intelelctualizqtion begins with the graveyard. we’ll begin with an american gym. attractive 21-year-olds all wearing tight clothes and you, the 61-year-old, longing for what you can never have again: that. 

intellectually we understand we can’t go back. experientially, we work out, dye our hair, and have hair removed.
