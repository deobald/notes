# don’t torture yourself

# Hacking is Sharing

- getting a recipe vs. cooking w someone (pairing)
- Make and Notepad - using the tools available
    - Eric Liu "mastered Notepad" then showed others
      (also a mastered programmer in his own right)
      could start/close, edit text files on any computer without touching mouse
    - "using the tools available to you" => the breath, the body
- Make: 'make install' => 'make test' => 'make deploy'
    - not really the intended use, but installed on every computer, so

# Hacking is Social

“social” in the sense of sharing, not social media, social networks, or revelry. cooperation. MIT was social but the activity very solitary. Cooking clubs or book clubs are social even if the practice of cooking or reading tends to be a private activity.

# “something bigger than myself”

- everyone is their own main character
- looking for something larger, more important, to be a part of
- “noble death”

## intellectualize it

most intelelctualizqtion begins with the graveyard. we’ll begin with an american gym. attractive 21-year-olds all wearing tight clothes and you, the 61-year-old, longing for what you can never have again: that.

intellectually we understand we can’t go back. experientially, we work out, dye our hair, and have hair removed.

## ledi sayadaw / webu sayadaw

focusing on the known monastics in the tradition, one gets two sets of instructions:

- anapana only, vipassana naturally
- anapana 5 hrs/day, then inspect the hairs of the body

it’s worth noting that for these teachers, restricting attention to an individual hair is the _beginning_ of the technique. that would still be considered “gross” sensation.

sati of a single hair, or of something equally singular but sutble, is therefore an observation of narrow anicca. craving arises when observing / experiencing larger portions of the body: sensation in aggregate

## Vipassana for Taoists

- break apart pieces of the body
- “why do you suffer? because you have a body!”

## Vipassana for Gamers

- zoom in/out of a battlefield / slaughter of sankharas in hell
- zelda: link’s awakening, light/dark world
