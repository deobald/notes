# VfoH airplane

# don’t torture yourself

- image of emaciated buddha
- comparison to that level of torture
- broken body (polio legs?) as comparison

# Hacker

- “life hacks”
- biohackers
-

# Hacking is Sharing

- getting a recipe vs. cooking w someone (pairing)
- Make and Notepad - using the tools available
    - Eric Liu "mastered Notepad" then showed others
      (also a mastered programmer in his own right)
      could start/close, edit text files on any computer without touching mouse
    - "using the tools available to you" => the breath, the body
- Make: 'make install' => 'make test' => 'make deploy'
    - not really the intended use, but installed on every computer, so

# Hacking is Social

“social” in the sense of sharing, not social media, social networks, or revelry. cooperation. MIT was social but the activity very solitary. Cooking clubs or book clubs are social even if the practice of cooking or reading tends to be a private activity.

# Vipassana is A-political

- not ESR “hacker”
- hacking is a-political
- meditators are asked not to mix politics and meditation

# gross to subtle

- imagination (“my left shoulder”) and intellectualization (“sensation is an indication of change”) are as gross as permitted

# DsU: exercise

- dance in a category with climbing and running
-

# DsU: keyboards

- belly to desk
- forearms fully on desk
- laptops NEVER

# anti-meditations

- push on a cycle / elliptical / treadmill- don’t look down at the screen
- “quitting smoking = NOT doing X. how hard could it be?”

# Service is Sila

- public service
- teachers
- doctors
- garbage men
-

# Can you "win" meditation?

- methodists: sanctification

# “something bigger than myself”

- everyone is their own main character
- looking for something larger, more important, to be a part of
- “noble death”

## intellectualize it

most intelelctualizqtion begins with the graveyard. we’ll begin with an american gym. attractive 21-year-olds all wearing tight clothes and you, the 61-year-old, longing for what you can never have again: that.

intellectually we understand we can’t go back. experientially, we work out, dye our hair, and have hair removed.

## ledi sayadaw / webu sayadaw

focusing on the known monastics in the tradition, one gets two sets of instructions:

- anapana only, vipassana naturally
- anapana 5 hrs/day, then inspect the hairs of the body

it’s worth noting that for these teachers, restricting attention to an individual hair is the _beginning_ of the technique. that would still be considered “gross” sensation.

sati of a single hair, or of something equally singular but sutble, is therefore an observation of narrow anicca. craving arises when observing / experiencing larger portions of the body: sensation in aggregate

## Vipassana for Taoists

- break apart pieces of the body
- “why do you suffer? because you have a body!”

## Vipassana for Gamers

- zoom in/out of a battlefield / slaughter of sankharas in hell
- zelda: link’s awakening, light/dark world

## On Wealth

wealth is generated by present action / kamma, not by praying to gods

- the birth of insight, p82

“wealthy barber, wealthy buddha” = reducing spend ~= wealth … reducing desire ~= wealth, parallels 

## Healing vs Destroying

- destruction is more “satisfying”
- carson wanted to heal his pimples — i wanted to destroy them

similarly, brightness vs dullness: from “brothers sun”: we find out why the main character is nicknamed “chairleg” after murdering a man at 14. he says killing becomes easier as he dulls to flavour, emotion, senses. the taints are a form of fuzzy darkness that dull all of human experience. the sharpest experiences are not those of refined elites with expensive taste but those of monks who taste a bowl of plain rice with every fibre of their being. 

explaining this to jill had been impossible. she asked “what do you think heaven is like?” and i explained that sometimes i would go outside and the entire world would glitter and shine, like it was some sort of ethereal cartoon. she didn’t like that idea and told me she assumed heaven meant spending time with other people — and loving them. which of course sounds much healthier than “i think heaven is like microdosing” but it was the experience of seeing (and feeling) the world in entirely new ways that i was trying to understand, to convey. this is brightness. 

## We are all children 

- 3yo niece upset “because my jacket is on wrong” … adults who get angry/upset when they don’t have enough calorie intake (and whose family knows them well enough to know this) — we often misattribute our successes, failures, and frustrations

## Halucination VS Reality

if you want to have xperience a mythology which is in fact Real, you need to shatter the constructed hallucinations which distort reality. the devas and asuras are there to experience directly. you currently see them as taxes and evil coworkers

## learn to swim 

not always a relaxed back stroke in a calm pool … sometimes surviving a flood. western contemporary mindfulness pictures a forced vacation to the calm pond, somehow, amidst floods and tsunamis and hurricanes everywhere else — including the mind
