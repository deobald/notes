Hello Friends and Family!

Preethi is trying to get a Canadian Permanent Residence card. Our first attempt (the Express Entry program) has moved very slowly and will expire in early 2021 so we're going to attempt the Common-Law Partner application process instead.

This document is designed to help explain what details you may want to include in a "recommendation letter" you write to the Canadian Government on our behalf, confirming that Preethi and I are --- in your eyes --- in a Common-Law Relationship.

The letter can be very simple.

1. In the salutation, address the letter to: `Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada`
2. You do not need To: and From: address lines; we will include your signed letter in Preethi's application.
3. Mention any or all of the following:
    a) Preethi and I have been in a Common-Law relationship since September 2017, when we first moved in together.
    b) If we have visited you together, stayed in your home, etc.
    c) That you know Preethi and I to share expenses (rent, hotels, food, travel)
    d) That Preethi and I have rarely been apart for more than a couple weeks at a time for over 3 years.
    e) That Preethi and I both know each other's families very well and visit them often.
    f) If you happen to be family, you could go into more detail regarding (e).
    g) Public (in person or online) events, meetings, etc. that you know of or want to make IRCC aware of. These could be photos, social media, or other correspondence. If the resource is available at a public URL (website) it will be easier for you to include in the letter without an additional attachment.
4. Declare your statements to be true.
5. Provide contact information for yourself in case IRCC wants to confirm details:
    a) Email Address
    b) Phone Number
    c) Mailing Address
7. Sign the letter

You can send us a scan; we don't need to send the original with your signature on it.

Thank you one million, everybody. With your help, hopefully Preethi can immigrate to Canada! :)

Love,
Steven & Preethi
