"do not crave for objects" ... status, power, position, comforts
... not even for good things, for that leads to hating the bad

"we don't hate the coyotes"
"we protect without involvement of the protected - it's not a paradox for us"

* offer wooden boat skills
* attacked by coyotes
* visit ruins
* set out to find bears, some gnomes come

## Coyotes

* people apalled by eating meat
* live in ruins, caves
* sextant found in caves/ruins - coyotes explain planetary motion, calendars, clocks, hunting

## Story

* journey down toward the water
* meeting gnomes
* performance in village ... predicting what?
  * flashback
* gnomes insist Trin go back, walking with her
* using gnome's prepared/dried wood for boat

No one expects the path downhill to hurt more. For older People, it was universally understood that the walk downhill meant sore knees for days. Youthful bodies don't process the damage quickly enough and youthful brains don't interpret the risk early enough, which leads to a lot more jumping and running down the hill than is strictly necessary. By the fourth day, the children could barely walk.

"Why didn't your magic powers predict how much this would hurt?" asked Nikki, projecting his self-pity on Paz and Trin. They ignored him. Everyone knew they needed to find a level patch of ground, preferably with some cover, to sleep for the night. Their attention was drawn to their knees and leg muscles, a confusing blend of burning lactic acid searing through soft flesh in underground rivers of lava flowing and curving around the acute, metallic pain in their joints. Where the kneecap rubbed felt like sucking on a nail tastes.

The pain made it difficult to enjoy the scenery. The trees shimmered and the moss undulated in emerald waves. Millions of leaves swelled into a crisp orchestra, conducted by the wind. The earth was soft and supple and invited all four of them to give up, lay down, and rest. Their beds at home weren't as soft and comfortable as these thick layers of moss. They knew this intimately, since the moss had provided their beds last night. The shade of the forest's canopy would have been perfect for napping under. But it was only mid-morning and they could hardly justify stopping now. They were no longer bouncing down the hill, instead, taking the time to feel each footfall and squish into the moss gently with every step. At intervals, they would come across Sarracenia Pitcher Plants and stomp on them to hear the satisfying crunch of the plant's stiff flesh and the splash of the plant's contents. They always seemed to be holding water, even if it had been days since it rained. They were a brighter green than all the other plants, the sort of green the sky would be if it were green instead of blue.

A crow sat on a large limb of a tall, dead birch tree. "If I could start fires, I'd use this branch," the bird thought to himself. His wife appeared and they greeted one another. The kids looked up with the sort of wave of one's head used to shake off a sound, much like the wave of a hand to shake off a mosquito or black fly. The motion is one of minimal effort, telegraphing how little care was invested into it from the get-go. The sort of motion a Person employs only to say "I don't really care about this." Only Trin bothered to locate the crows, a symptom of either her premonitions or her youth, or both.

The crows knew what lay ahead for the children they observed down on the forest floor. Perhaps it was the jet-black suits they wore out or perhaps it was the raspy, scratching sound of their voices but the People tended to feel that crows were somehow a bit sinister. But one shouldn't mistake intelligence for malice any more than one should permit oneself to mistake stupidity for malice and the crows were, nine times out of ten, simply curious due to their intelligence. The People knew this. They would construct puzzles for the crows the crows could often solve. And they had seen them use tools, a mark of an intelligent creature. 

Crows were Trin's favourite bird, and she enjoyed meeting their eyes from below even though she couldn't see into them.

The birds slowly motioned their necks from one side to the other as they silently observed the kids slogging their way down the moss, only stopping to inspect and occasionally eat mushrooms they found along the way. The male crow could see the glimmer of the ocean from his perch and his heart sank as it always did when he caught sight of it, knowing that it was impossible for him to venture out onto the waters as his forefathers, for the days of pirates were long gone. Pirates came in all flavours and in this part of the world, they tended toward flavours of Privateer or Buccaneer... which is to say, of course, that the larger governments paid and promoted their pirate activities in support of "free trade." The birds didn't understand this idea; they didn't really understand the concept of owning things. While they were very capable of solving puzzles and using tools and collecting treasure, they had no sense of ownership over the tools or treasure or prizes at the end of a puzzle. If the prize was food, they ate it. If it was a shiny rock, they'd add it to their pile of shiny rocks... fully expecting another crow to come take half their rocks. Regardless of whether the birds appreciated Free Trade, they did appreciate sitting on the shoulders of scarred, amputee pirates. It made them feel cool.
