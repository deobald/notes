"do not crave for objects" ... status, power, position, comforts
... not even for good things, for that leads to hating the bad

"we don't hate the coyotes"
"we protect without involvement of the protected - it's not a paradox for us"

* mushroom tea
* parties?
* treehouses, build slowly, take little
* offer wooden boat skills
* attacked by coyotes
* visit ruins
* set out to find bears, some gnomes come

## Coyotes

* people apalled by eating meat
* live in ruins, caves
* sextant found in caves/ruins - coyotes explain planetary motion, calendars, clocks, hunting
