# Juxt Framework

All meaningful frameworks answer big questions: what should we do => what should i do => how will i do it => why am i doing it => who am i

## we • i

## how 

Set direction by seeking clarity above all else. Clarity can come from insight, reason, and knowledge. Clarity does not cause rationality nor does it activate behaviour. Understanding how and why one behaves enables one to alter one’s behaviour. 

Both are required: Gain clarity to see which paths are available. Change behaviour to walk a path.

Walking one path, while increasing clarity and strengthening behaviour, builds momentum. 

## why 

- hacker ethos 
- leave it better than you found it 
- continuity, longevity, sustainability 
- “ride my bicycle until i fall off” == most boring idea possible 
- … but work as an end unto itself is not wrong (dalai lama)
- these trees are for god 

## who am i

The question cannot be answered by the inquirer directly. If the answer could be reasoned out, it could be written down. We would have all read that book if it existed. It doesn’t. 

“Who am i?” presents a paradox which must be answered by tools capable of resolving paradoxes. 

## what should we do

- start from where we are
- arc of time
- arc of humanity
- arc of technology
- technology adjacency 
- society’s problems solved by the collective action of individuals
- big problems solved by intelligent solutions taken in tiny steps

- ideas => reification 
- simplify comprehension by making an idea concrete, approachable 
- ideas = four provinces
- reification = xtdb, site, card
