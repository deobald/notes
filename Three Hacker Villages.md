## 2030

We really didn't know what we were doing.

We proved that with countless failed experiments first. No financial planning led to sagging, leaking shacks. Open-ended projects lacking ideals lent themselves to giant tracts of land with no buildings. Narrow ideals and over-tightened constraints created stunted utopias like Auroville.

Few people deal well with structural, social, or systemic collapse. Most thrash and claw at the original concept, in an attempt to keep it alive. Of course, the clawing itself is what causes an idea or ideal to die a slow, bloody death of a thousand tiny cuts if it wasn't already destined to die of neglect. Clear manifestos help prevent the conversation from devolving into a debate about metaphysics and semantics. Someone asking "What are we even trying to do, here?" is a good sign that the constitution of the idea is not well understood, which in turn means it isn't written down. But under the circumstances where the constitution of a project was understood, agreed upon, and documented, death is delivered by drift. Every idea will inevitably become outmoded and a constitution anchors an organization -- both preventing the distraction of fads and ephemeral, adjacent ideals, flitting in and out of existence alongside the original principles, and preventing the institution from maturing as sea changes in human endeavour change the destination, mid-journey. If enough members of a community are sufficiently distracted by fads, the community will drift and the constitution is unlikely to follow. In some cases, it cannot.

The early twenty-first century was the temporal home of many such drift events. Projects and institutions built on appropriately-scoped ideals became the victims of the polarizing effect of a societal sportsmanship labelled "politics." Of course, the discourse was never political. An imaginary sport was built of imaginary opinion and everyone was asked to pick a team in a league with only two teams, no matter what language they spoke or country they were from. It was a very annoying time. Counter-culture movements intended to supplant this global stupidity were instead assimilated into the stupidity, co-opted into one team or the other. Nuance was the target of international war plans, nuked from orbit.

And so it was. Every institution devolved its own internal conversations into discussions about the topic de jour. Those that suffered the most from this disease were the projects and organizations which attempted a structural change to a small part of society itself. It was difficult for anyone to focus long enough to build a house when every conversation was drowned by the screaming about genocides on the other side of the globe or the sexual identity of community members. It didn't matter which side of the argument participants took. The fight, not the dangerous opinion (and there almost always was a dangerous opinion between the two), was the disease.

Unexpectedly, this disease -- Psuedo-Politics As Sport -- was one of many uncomfortable realities about this century which enabled us to eventually succeed at creating Hacker Villages, despite all our ineptitude.

The other discomforts played into our undeserved success in more obvious ways. Across most countries where we began to operate, housing was a catastrophe. Canada and the United States of America in 2030 were struggling with homelessness and a generation of frustrated, disillusioned young professionals uncertain about their place in this world. India's economy meant the middle class could avoid every normal discomfort of adult life: washing dishes, mopping the floor, or even driving a car. But land was expensive even if the labour required to build a house was not. Japan had a seemingly-infinite number of available houses but building codes had outstripped old construction, making homes of any sort a liability rather than an asset. Korea had sufficient housing but a dwindling population. Climate castastrophes were obliterating entire cities: by rising sea level on the coast and by unrelenting forest fires on the sides of mountains.

Uncertainty breeds fear. Just as an animal who doesn't know if a danger is immediate bites and growls, an uncertain modern human society, for all its comforts, led people to lash out and isolate themselves as often as it led them to band together and create stronger communities. It felt as though the entire world was on edge, exhausted, frustrated. Never allowing ourselves to take our finger off the trigger. An apocalypse so ubiquitous and ever-present that no one noticed it taking over our lives even though we spoke about nothing else.

It was the perfect time to rebuild societies, chunk by chunk.
