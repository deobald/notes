  - code = air = motion 
  - form = water = binding
  - data = earth = solidity
  - time = fire = prevailing temperature 
- teach the controversy 
- how is time = fire? think “liveness”

- identity = causally related values over time 
- cause? effect? events!
- most important identity = me … who am i?
