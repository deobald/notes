# VFH Rationality

feelings => beliefs VS rationality — _New Hopes_ p167

we know we are not rational (ref. predictably irrational?) but we desire and strive for rationality. what is non-obvious is that strong emotion and rationality are incompatible — one cannot have strong feelings about a subject one believes to have approached through rationality, nor can one have strong feelings about rationality itself

# Why Meditate

- Posture
- alcohol
- sexual self-harm
- "rationalists" - we cannot think our way out of the problem
- philsophy does not liberate the philosopher, much less the reader
- note: "liberation" is incremental
