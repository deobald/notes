# Crux Website Spec

(Not using any potential name-changes yet.)


## One-liner

The current website has a pretty good one:

```
"Crux is an open source database with temporal graph query."
```

## One Paragraph

The following is kind of long and has many words, but it captures most of what makes Crux special. 

```
Crux is a general-purpose, open source graph database. It has a powerful query planner based on recent Worst-Case Optimal Join (WCOJ) algorithm research. Data can be queried in either SQL or Datalog -- from native Java and Clojure libraries or over the HTTP API. Completely immutable, Crux also permits _eviction_ of data for legal compliance with legislation like GDPR. Crux is a schema-less store, allowing unstructured data to be recorded and analyzed. As structure emerges, unstructured data can evolve, crystallizing into structured data across the Crux timeline. All of this is made possible by the bi-temporal storage underpinning every entity Crux records. The bi-temporal indexes are based on over three decades of research in temporal data structures. The bi-temporal timeline is completely automatic in Crux; developers do not need to think about it at all. However, when desired, the temporal indexes enable systems to record data in the past and future -- and to use time-traveling queries to witness the database as if from another point in time entirely.
