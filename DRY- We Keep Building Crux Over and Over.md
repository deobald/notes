# DRY- We Keep Building Crux Over and Over

## Kafka

Crux is an answer to a question many different software teams in many different offices around the globe keep asking themselves in many different ways. Everyone has built an "unbundled database" in large services projects to support the business but building one in a _reusable_ way is a multi-year, full-time endeavour and it is not the Unique Selling Proposition of Twitter, Goldman Sachs, or Uber to build an unbundled, bitemporal, standards-compliant, immutable graph database.

## Graph

Rather than layering GraphQL over 50-year-old database technology, graph query should be the default.

## Normalization

Rather than duplicating + transforming data into analytics databases, keep it structured in the language of the business (immutable records).
