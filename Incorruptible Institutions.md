# Incorruptible Institutions

there is no institution which is incorruptible 

meditator friends are always surprised when i say that it’s hard to find right livelihood in software, but that’s because most software companies begin their lives corrupted and that’s not obvious to anyone who would compare them to regular businesses. 

it always matter infinitely more what you create than what you consume. your entire pattern of consumption, from filet mignonette vs seitan to twitter vs mastodon, will always round to zero. you don’t matter. 

but you do. what you create matters a great deal, to you and to the world.
