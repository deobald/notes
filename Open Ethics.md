* Design v. Control: In the past 20 years, we have come to recognize various qualities of software in parallel. We want beautiful, well-designed software (Apple, Firefox) but we also want software we own and control (Linux, Emacs). Historically, these have been at odds with one another and one had to choose between "design" or "control". Now we need both.
* Regulation: In the classic car analogy, laws don't allow anyone to make any modification to their car they like. There are guidelines and rules. Similarly, in infrastructure which affects the population at large (Linux, MRI machines) there are regulations -- both in the form of traditional legislation and self-governance -- which prevent catastrophe.
