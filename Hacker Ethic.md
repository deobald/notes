# Hacker Ethic

- loathe inefficiency 
- avoid waste 
- avoid pointless bureaucracy and unnecessary complexity
- open knowledge 
- sharing 
- cooperation 
- “open competition”
- embrace curiosity 
- exploration is allowed 
- show the path from A to B
- apolitical 

## user-hacker 

the user and the creator are not distinct roles but a spectrum from someone who uses the tool to someone to creates or modifies it. 

hypercard, doom, minecraft, vb6, linux, and excel are examples of user-hacker friendly tools. foss licensing allows “hacking” at every layer, whether the tool is friendly to user-hackers or not. 

do not talk down to the users. do not infantilize them.
