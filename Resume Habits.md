# Resume Habits

* review multiple times, checking for typos
* commas to denote separation of address parts
* no periods at the end of bullet points

## Consistency

* use the same date format everywhere
* segregate Roles, Tools, Implementation Details, and Outcomes
* focus on Outcomes:
    * first prize
    * procurement explorer
    * policy changes in Assam
    * policy paper responses = listened to
    * won grants
    * avoid "worked on X"
    * published FOSS report
    * successfully delivered Novo projects
    * organized symposia
    * built a medical communications team
    * avoid "involved in"
* put references into reverse-chrono order

## Wording

* "First Prize: Taiwanese Presidential Hackathon 2020 for innovative uses of open data"
* avoid superfluous adjectives: "various", etc.
* "worked on social media campaigns" => "ran social media campaigns"
* "wrote foss report" => "published foss report"
* "created a team" => "built a team"
* "worked on training writers" => "trained writers"
    * use the direct verb everywhere

## TODOs

* [ ] format all months as whole words
* [ ] for ATS resumes:
    * try `vitae`: https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae
* [ ] for academic / human CVs:
    * try `stevetemplates`: http://svmiller.com/stevetemplates/ and http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/03/svm-r-markdown-cv/ (plus a second page)
* [ ] create an "Experience Details" section for 2-page Academic CV
* [ ] create a "Skills" section for both resumes:
    * languages: R, Python (Beautiful Soup), maybe SAS Language
    * tools: R Studio, Apache Superset, Jupyter, DataVision, SAS, SPSS, Excel, git, GitHub
* [ ] consider removing the CDL fellowship and moving those dates into work experience
