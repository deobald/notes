# Krishnamurti

While she was reading Suzuki and Wilber, not without a satisfaction of her own, he was reading Krishnamurti. His satisfaction was of a different kind, a sort of arrogance that only befalls 25-year-old men. He didn't understand Jiddu's words but they certainly _appeared_ true and he was unaware he didn't understand them. With each chapter, he would glow. "Yes, this is it!" he would beam internally. He didn't read Krishnamurti as though he might be Krishnamurti's student. He read Krishnamurti _as Krishnamurti_. Imagining himself on the stage, the great lay monk, bringing awe and inspiration to a generation of middle-class seekers. "The answer is not in a book," Krishnamurti might say. "The answer is not in any book" he would regurgitate, mentally, as if the thought had arisen spontaneously inside himself. He would take a moment to digest it, then proceed to look for his answers in Jiddu's book.
