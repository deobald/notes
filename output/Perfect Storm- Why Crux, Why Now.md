# Perfect Storm: Why Crux, Why Now

Why can't I find a common English phrase like "Perfect Storm" with positive connotations? "Strike while the iron is hot" is close, but it implies we're running out of time to build Crux...

> "In action, watch the timing."

## Conceptual / External

- Time: 30+ years of bitemp research
    - Jensen, Snodgrass, others (90s) = readiness
- Immutability: Facts replace state, events maintain `tx-time` symmetry
- Evict: GDPR is the beginning of "mandatory eviction capability"
- Query: Replacing SQL with SPARQL, GraphQL, Datalog
- Graph: Relationships matter more than Nouns in modern data models
- Records: Documents > Rows IFF (standardized?) graph query exists
    - seamless: "mapping" data is outmoded

## Concrete / Internal

- JVM
- Clojure
- Kafka
- Postgres, RocksDB, etc.

## Philosophical

- "An Aeon is a long time... but it's not forever" (only if `aeon`)
    - Crux is not a perfect idea which will last an eternity, but as Relational/Table served computing for 50 years, Crux will serve computing for the next 50
