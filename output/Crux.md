## Concepts

- second brain ala second life (hack fest)
- Vertex Duck Typing
- dependencies
    - Farbrausch: fr-0.1 "constant evolution" vs. fr-016 vs. big demos (DirectX)
    - when are "big" dependencies okay?
- tinkertoy / lego / china patent 
- enterprise bus ?
- axxo, stealing, shoulders of giants 
- learning a language:
    - table = learning by rote
    - document record = learning phrases
    - triple = learning only individual words
- hard v soft | repeating v unique | flat v nested
- Postgres is a beautiful piece of engineering for a 50-year-old idea
- crystalize over time: schema knobs
- environments
    - what is the "environment"?
    - python / ruby environments = self-contained (sys, pkg, pyenv, xkcd)... shell
    - _Hackers_ on the OS, time-share environments
    - Do you want to be close to the metal or protected? How much of each?
