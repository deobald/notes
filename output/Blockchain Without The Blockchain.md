# Blockchain Without The Blockchain

- Matt Levine - blockchain, distributed databases, "crypto"
- Audrey Tang - "git is a distributed ledger"
- ledgers, accountants, look-ups
    - index(es) - expensive to maintain
    - the graph was always there, whether reified or not
- non-distributed => [[[Consensus Considered Harmful](https://github.com/deobald/notes/blob/master/output/Consensus%20Considered%20Harmful.md)]]
- how do you `evict` from a blockchain?
