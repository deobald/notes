Hello Friends and Family!

Preethi is trying to get a Canadian Permanent Residence card. Our first attempt (the Express Entry program) has moved very slowly and will expire in early 2021 so we're going to attempt the Common-Law Partner application process instead.

This document is designed to help explain what details you may want to include in a "recommendation letter" you write to the Canadian Government on our behalf, confirming that Preethi and I are --- in your eyes --- in a Common-Law Relationship.

We hope to apply as soon as Preethi receives her Police Certificate ("WE DECREE PREETHI GOVINDARAJAN = DEFINITELY NOT A CRIME LORD.") from India, which should happen in 4-6 weeks... early February, if we're lucky. If you've sent us a recommendation letter by then, we'll use it!


## (1) Help and Suggestions

The letter can be very simple. It can contain anything you want.

1. In the salutation, address the letter to: `"Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada"` (without quotes)
2. You do not need `To:` and `From:` address lines, since you don't need to mail the letter yourself; email your signed letter to us and we will include it in Preethi's application.
3. Mention any or all of the following:
   1. Preethi and I have been in a Common-Law relationship since September 2017, when we first moved in together.
   2. If we have visited you together, stayed in your home, etc.
   3. That you know Preethi and I to share expenses (rent, hotels, food, travel)
   4. That Preethi and I have rarely been apart for more than a couple weeks at a time for over 3 years.
   5. That Preethi and I both know each other's families very well and visit them often.
   6. If you happen to be family, you could go into more detail regarding (e).
   7. Public (in person or online) events, meetings, etc. that you know of or want to make IRCC aware of. These could be photos, social media, or other correspondence. If the resource is available at a public URL (website) it will be easier for you to include in the letter without an additional attachment.
   8. How long you have known Preethi... or how long you have known me... or both.
   9. If you have ever lived with me or Preethi (as an adult).
   10. Stories: funny, weird, or otherwise. IRCC seems quite happy to inquire about very personal details, so please feel free to include any obscure detail you like.
4. Declare your statements to be true.
5. Provide contact information for yourself in case IRCC wants to confirm details:
    a) Email Address
    b) Phone Number
    c) Mailing Address
7. Sign the letter


## (2) How to Sign

### (a) Olden-days: Scanning

You can send us a scan of a printout with your signature; we don't need to send the original with your signature on it. The letter does not need to be handwritten... but that would be fun, if anyone wants to do that.

### (b) Newen-days: PDF Signatures

You can create the letter on Google Docs and then use "File => Print" to turn it into a PDF.

1. If you are on a Mac, open the PDF in `Preview`. You can sign it with "Tools => Annotate => Signature".
2. If you are on Windows, open the PDF in `Adobe Acrobat Reader DC`. You can sign it with "Sign => Fill & Sign => Sign button"

Then you can email the "signed" PDF to either me or Preethi. Tada!

Thank you one million, everybody. With your help, hopefully Preethi can immigrate to Canada! :)

Love,
Steven & Preethi
