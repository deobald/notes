## Conversation w Kitty

when i first tried eyes-open zazen, i wondered why vipassana was strictly eyes-closed for the students. but on my second course i came to realize that sense of scale becomes really wacky in deep meditation. you can be really zoomed into your own body, or really zoomed out. or the scale and experience level you're having isn't relevant to your body at all.

none of that can happen when your eyes are open. i tried opening my eyes once or twice during the course, and that experience stops completely. so there are places you can't go with eyes open.

much later, a person is asked to meditate while standing/walking, eyes open, and feel/see impermanence everywhere (even outside the body) ... but that's quite a high stage that i doubt i'll ever get to, and it doesn't vary scale.

the variation in scale is used to get a clearer sense of impermanence in a tiny spot on the body, mostly. once the mind is accustomed to feeling impermanence/anicca everywhere, you can sweep the body "en masse" or even feel the entire body at once. i think the "entire body at once" instruction is first given on the 20- or 30-day course.

“my body sleeps. my mind doesn’t sleeps.”
“we can cheat others. we can’t cheat ourselves.”
