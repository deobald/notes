* convergence of ideas:
    * self-hosting
    * bare metal
    * zero deps
    * open source
    * commercially viable without producing another new billionaire
    * open protocols (nokia phone: tel, text ... fax, email)
    * federation (email, imap - gmail=>fastmail)
    * interop / open formats / a way out / exit strategy
    * open web
    * Right To Repair
    * retro computing
    * demoscene
* a different kind of "optimism":

    * "optimism" at 17:00-ish / 17:30+

    * "it's like permaculture, but for computing" isn't a very good description
    * https://permacomputing.net/design_for_descent/ - enables ubiquitous computing, lower-powered devices, etc.
    * Build on Solid Ground - low deps, stable deps, Boring Technology
    * share source code AND design
    * facilitate observation (visualization)
    * avoid centralization
    * rediscovering that we've been "tricked into timesharing again":

    * good design
    * simplicity
    * no login
    * less, not more
    * ease of use
    * it just works
    * 1 minute boot-to-kill

* resurgence of retro computing
* an app/game for a 40-year-old amiga still works
* "everything is harder with the internet" is a cop-out
    * local-first
    * disagree on https://permacomputing.net/retro/

* software can be "Done"

* local-first
    * longevity
    * sovereign computing
    * right to repair
    * reliability

* users ~= developers
    * barefoot developers - Maggie Appleton
