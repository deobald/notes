# Fiction

it was a primordial sound, like a dravidian stop consonant followed by a long but indeterminate aspirated vowel. were north american men in pain when they poop?

* in the context of hitting on someone or fishing for compliments: "anglo indians be anglin'"

those who hated my father - my family - hated out of impotence as much as ignorance. and now we are those people. not hating a high school teacher but hating the governments we have elected (and those we haven’t) with all the vitriol of an unworldly teenager. we aren’t focused on problems. we’re focused on indulging our anger.

if we want to make use of this anger, the worlds mafias have known for a long time what solution is sound: don’t attack the individual but attack what he loves. destroy family, friends, colleagues, institutions. destroy them slowly, from the inside. feel nothing in extracting this revenge and already be 80% of the way to the next execution when this job is finally finished.

## slut

hindi word for “slut” (?) on a boy’s t-shirt, tiny lettering

meri hindion bahut gandi hain

## airplanes

i watch them give the safety demo. will they be performative? bored? or both? the girl with the glasses uses excessive hand gestures. the girl with the bleach blonde hair has done this thousands of times but still indulges a flourish with the information card in the back of your seat.

is flying in a holding pattern as satisfying as riding a motorcycle on an oval track? is this the best part of the job?

the sun scans my leg as we rotate around in a figure eight. i can’t tell if i love or hate the warmth but it makes my leg hairs sweat. it reminds me of the light from passing cars on the street when i was 4 years old. that memory reminds me that, at 4, i could never quite work out how the bands of light produced by the cars driving parallel to the front of my house could move so smoothly across the back wall of my bedroom, like a spotlight on a stage.

## Foundation Sperm

There is this line from "Foundation", something to the effect of:

> You're a sperm led by its waving flagellum, mistaking its random motion for complexity.

Which does a fantastic job of explaining the root cause of the Earth Repopulation movement championed by recent billionaires. This is our basest impulse, and it happens to coincide with pleasure. There was never a time in our lives when the twin impulses to ejaculate and procreate were more in sync than when we were 18. Perhaps an exception to this rule exists for those with unbounded mountains of cash.
