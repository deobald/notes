# Open Source India: Coops

- what is a coop
- what is free/open software

There is a small emergent trend, particularly within India, of new software companies structuring themselves as cooperatives. More often than not, these software cooperatives have free (or open source) software as a key component of their business strategy. To understand why, we need to examine exactly what these two concepts intend to achieve, where they intersect, and how they diverge.

Cooperatives take on different political colours the world over and even a quick read of the Wikipedia entry on cooperatives will demonstrate just how unclear some of the ideals become in different socioeconomic contexts. [1] Some coops take on shades of socialism while others reject the principles of charity and welfare altogether. What unifies coops is their conformance to The Cooperative Identity, and little else. [2] The core operational aspects of this Identity are found in the seven Cooperative Principles (formerly Rochdale Principles). [3] Software coops tend to be structured as worker coops, where each employee controls one share or vote in the corporation. Membership, control, and capital are described by the first three Cooperative Principles. While the democratic control of worker coops defines their structure as a corporation, it is adherence to the remaining four principles which causes coops to share ideological space with the free and open source software (FOSS) movements: autonomy, education, cooperation, and community. We can examine how each of these four axes intersects with FOSS.

Unlike coops, FOSS ideals say nothing about these four axes. The Free Software philosophy describes a system of ethics underpinning the user's Four Essential Freedoms which define whether software is Free or not. [4] Open Source values describe an "attitude" and "principles of the open source way" which underpin the Open Source Definition. [5,6,7] But none of these ethics or attitudes are directly encoded in the licenses which identify FOSS. By their very nature, FOSS licenses _do not dictate_ your behaviour. Cooperative corporations are legally bound to encode certain structures and behaviours into themselves. As it turns out, they happen to be the structures and behaviours which form the philosophical foundation of FOSS. As such, a cooperative enterprise will naturally gravitate toward FOSS, but not the other way around.

Coops seeking _autonomy_ requires that they actively avoid tethering themselves to other people, organizations, or resources which restrict them. Proprietary software is inherently restrictive to the consumer, so coops will always prefer to consume FOSS if they are aware of it.
