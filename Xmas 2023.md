## Chapter 1: For Preethi

The trees didn't disappear all at once. Losing the forest took generations and even though the Mushroom People knew the foreigners presented a danger, they rarely acted to stop them. Sometimes the foreigners wouldn't even be in the forest. On the occasions when they'd load up their sleds and drag the long corpses down the mountain and across the valley to their ships, the People would indulge in the relief of a silent forest, quickly forgetting that the silence had only returned to them temporarily.

But ultimately the trees did disappear. Unhealthy species of weak, soft trees took their place. Or bushes that barely qualified as trees at all. Or, in places, little more than grass and mud and stink. The Mushroom People relied on the trees for they provided homes for the mushrooms, the trees relied on the mushrooms for they connected the trees in vast networks, and the mushrooms relied on the people for they knew the seasons of the mushrooms and would spread spores to the farthest reaches of the forest at exactly the right times.

As Pazput sat near the edge of the cliff, she surveyed the stumps and the mud from above and pondered her People's present situation. "We can eat little else," she thought, "and even though everyone can survive on vegetables, most of us get sick if we don't have mushrooms every day."

She turned to Nikki. "Do you think we'll have to go to the caves? Will we end up eating shadow mushrooms like in the dark ages?"

Her expression looked more to Nikki like that of a Baduk player, puzzling over her next move, than one of fear. Nikki was a year older -- thirteen -- but he didn't worry about the world as Pazput did. He was either incapable of imaginging an improvement, or indifferent.

"I dunno, Paz?" he offered back. He was more concerned with the beauty of the osprey silently gliding across the blue sky beyond them.

She was tempted to launch into an exploration of available options. The diagnosis was understood. She wanted to find treatments. But she'd known Nikki since they began attending school, when he moved from a neighbouring village. She paused to give him a chance at a more intelligent response.

"How long does it take to get to the caves? Maybe we should just go eat a shadow mushroom and see if it's as bad as People say."

She was shocked by the practicality of the suggestion. The shadow mushrooms were derided by her People but it was universally understood that the shadows were edible.

"I suppose we could, right? It's a one-day journey, so we'd have to wait for the weekend. And... probably invite Trin and Vora."

"Oh. Come. On. Paz." he protested, "Trin and Vora? Are we going to need Vora's magic powers just to sleep in a cave for one night and eat some garbage?"

Pazput giggled. She knew Nikki struggled with Vora's religion. She also knew Nikki had a crush on Vora, which complicated things further. "There's no one else, Nik. The other kids are a risk -- they might tell the elders what we're doing."

"Just the two of us! We've gone weekend camping before."

"Nikki, we were kids. We haven't done that in years. You know as well as I do that no one's letting us go camping alone at this age."

"Gross, Paz. You're my sister."

"Sister from another mother, sure. But we already have to convince Mom and Dad to let us travel north, toward the caves. We don't need the burden of justifying anything else to them. They think Vora's responsible. And Trin is just a kid, so they know we won't do anything too dangerous."

"Fine," he trailed off as the osprey cut back across the sky and grabbed his attention away.

***

Back in the village, Pazput steeled herself against her first challenge: convincing Vora. She knew Trin would want to come along no matter what. Trin loved adventures with her older sister, and Vora didn't mind that Trin tagged along everywhere. After all, it says in the Scriptures to _Love thy siblings as you will love your own child. Feed her your first mushrooms and best mushrooms._

Pazput navigated her argument methodically, appealing to the Scriptures with anything she could bring herself to remember about them.

"How can you treat everyone with love and care if there is nothing to eat? If the shadows are as difficult to eat as the stories say, and we don't find a solution to the deforestation, your children will suffer the lives of ghosts here on Earth!"

"Remember that it is our duty to prepare for adulthood now, early. What better way to prepare than to begin with real problem-solving?"

"Even if we learn nothing, at least we tried! Don't the scriptures tell us _better to puzzle and puzz than to place the Baduk stone the same way as last time_?" Pazput couldn't quite remember how this sutra was spoken.

Vora had that look on her face. Quiet consideration, compassion, empathy, and judgment. Pazput found it difficult to believe she was on the receiving end of the first three.

"There isn't a prophecy..." Vora began, slowly. Pazput heard that tone of Vora's that said "I'm not convinced." She'd heard it plenty of times before, arguing for reason and research over habit and history.

"Nik will come." she interrupted. She instantly regretted it. Nikki was already uncomfortable with the situation and now she was offering him up, like crow meat to a dog. She wasn't even sure if the dog was interested.

But Vora's eyebrows gave her away. "Nikki thinks this is a good idea?" she inquired in a new tone. Not a tone that belied a crush. Neither was it sing-song or confused and nervous. It was the tone of desperation. Vora's parents were as religious as she was, perhaps more, and outside of school she rarely interacted with boys. Only with the village tetering on the precipice of famine might her parents actually allow her to go on a foraging trip for the weekend. Since they would eat the shadow mushrooms, the foraging part wasn't even a lie...right? Maybe this was okay. Her stomach burned and sank, then bounced back up into her throat.

"Sure okay," she blurted. Vora rarely lost her composure like this and the skin on Pazput's face revealed its surprise by exposing too much of the whites in her eyes. It was as if Vora was worried the offer would vaporize if she didn't accept it quickly enough.

"Great, alright! See you Saturday morning at dawn, at Nikki's hut!" Pazput blurted out, almost as quickly, because she _knew_ Vora might come to her senses and back out if she didn't conclude the transaction quickly. Vora's honour could be relied on to trump her good senses.

***

Pazput hated the sound of her name. The alliterative quality of the two "puh" sounds drove her nuts when strangers would call her by her complete name. And seeing it abbreviated to "P.P." on paper always left her with a feeling in her chest that was the internal sensation equivalent to an eye-roll in the world outside her body.

So bound up was she with her parents. They were conservative. Not like Vora's parents and their outdated ideas about boys and duty and school. But her parents were politically conservative. When the village council or the district panchayat made plans, they fell in line with the Old Ways: stay put, don't get involved with the foreigners, don't try to change things.

She loved them more than anything but she couldn't understand this. _The world is changing, whether you want to change with it or not._ she would think, as they'd discuss responses to change over dinner that she considered non-responses: hunting for mushrooms more carefully in the old locations, staying home and conserving energy so they didn't need to eat so much. She didn't want to venture far, either, but she knew that wrapping herself in the Old Ways like a blanket was suicide.

Perhaps her name was an indication that she was just different from her parents in some fundamental way. They were the only people who refused to shorten her name. And the only people from whom she didn't hate that "puh-puh" sound.

***

Dinner was the time for bringing up political issues, and a camping trip north of the village was definitely the realm of politics. Adults generally didn't walk there and they were shocked by her suggestion.

"This is a very unorthodox idea, Pazput. Tell me what you will do when you encounter the Matangos?" her father queried.

"You know as well as I do that the Matangos are harmless, Dad. They might look like mushrooms but they know we mean them no harm. And they don't have any issues with us eating the fruit of the real mycillium under the trees. They aren't family."

Chichioya was taken aback by his daughter's confidence. She was always a rational person, but she normally didn't confront the family with her rationality over a steaming plate of mushroom.

He paused to think but words didn't come. He glanced over at Paz's mother, but Hahaoya's arguments had already been exhausted by her husband. Their cautious nature wasn't backed up by argument, since they rarely had to argue a position the entire village already agreed with.

Kannala, Paz's grandmother, swallowed a small cube of mushroom fried in mustard oil. The foreigners had told her this preparation tasted like fish but she did not know what a fish tasted like and had no intention of finding out.

"Let the child go, Chichi. It's just two days and maybe she'll even find some nice mushrooms to share with us."

Looking at Paz as she said this, Kannala smiled the smile of grandmothers. The smile that all at once conveys infinite love, decades of wisdom, and an authority that no one at the dinner table would dare challenge.

In an instant, the matter was settled and Kannala returned to her simulated fish as if nothing had transpired.

***

Paz, Nikki, Trin, and Vora walked in a line through the forest. From the osprey's vantage point, they were the tiniest army of ants. Too few in number to survive on their own.

The osprey imagined swooping down and picking them up, like rats or fish. If the People were small enough, would they be best scooped up by the neck? They don't have tails. Or, if they do, their tails seem to small to act as a handle, with which to carry them into the sky. Which is a shame because if you want to smash food on the rocks, it's best to turn it around so the head smashes first. Maybe grab them by the leg? But they have thick legs, for such little People. Oh? The tiny ants vanished into the bush already.

None of them felt small. They felt brave. Trin's bravery came from the company of her older sister. Vora's bravery came from her faith in the Gods. Paz and Nikki's bravery came from their experience. This wasn't their first time deep into the woods -- but it was their first time with their parents' permission.

"How long until we see a Matango?" asked Trin for the umpteenth time.

"We might not see any Mantangos," sighed Paz, tired of providing complete answers. She was suddenly glad she was an only child. Nikki was all the sibling she needed.

Trin sagged. Suddenly her older friends began to feel like stand-ins for her parents. Not nearly so religious, but nearly as boring. At least her parents played exciting music during the fire and the sacrifice. She loved the chanting. Mentally, she began one of the mantras she was so accustomed to performing with her family but before she could finish one stanza, the dull feeling Paz left her with had lifted. The mantra hadn't done it. Eyes did.

"Did you see THAT?!" she exclaimed. She flopped to one side of the path to get a better look at the eyes which had peered around a thick and gnarled birch tree. This time it was Vora's turn to throw cold water on Trin. She grabbed her by the collar and yanked her back onto the path.

"Yes, idiot. We saw it. And we'd like to see it again, so please don't terrify the Matango with your shouting?"

Trin pouted for a moment but she was too wired to feign hurt feelings. She'd never seen anything quite like it. The mushroom creature wasn't terrified at all and slid its muffin top head back around the tree again, eyes bulging. One pudgy foot made its way onto the path. Then another. Paz couldn't tell for sure, but it seemed to be a child? Maybe even a toddler.

Two older Matangos appeared behind the small one. The smaller of the three was obviously a child... but the toddling appeared to be a property of all Matangos. They waddled like penguins but Paz guessed these fat little marshmallows wouldn't compensate for immobility on land with graceful swimming. Despite their waddling, the Matangos managed to surround them. Not a threatening gesture. More like a collective hug. The Matangos smiled and grumbled, pointing toward their village.

Of the four of them, Nikki was the only one who hesitated as they walked deeper into the woods than they had ever gone, toward the caves.

"How can we be sure we can trust these guys? Sure, they're cute... but so is a river otter. Have you ever seen an otter shred a fish with those little triangle razors in its mouth? Terrifying."

But even Nikki couldn't resist the sound of the drums. They'd all heard the stories of the Matangos' incessant music. But as they approached the caves from the south, the drumming was otherworldly, as if the forest itself was drumming. The fast-paced drum beat was everywhere, all at once, even though they could tell they still had hours of walking before they'd reach the village and hear it at full volume.

***

As they approached the village, the drums welcomed them. Loud, throbbing beats were the soundtrack of the jungle. Paz hadn't been this deep in the jungle before, even on her most irresponsible days. The trees grew taller near the caves, their foliage producing a permanent cloud of darkness across everything. It was a surprise to Paz and Nikki just how many trees were left this far north and this far into the hills... though they both knew these trees would be food for the foreigners' machines next. There were no mushrooms at the feet of the trees yet.

The darkness and the drumming had a symmetry. As the darkness enveloped everything on the forest floor, the drumming hugged their chests. "I can feel this in my heart," whispered Nikki to Vora. She was confused by his meaning, and a butterfly somehow managed to squeeze into her bellybutton, fly around her stomach, and settle in her throat.

The Matangos who led the way toward the village turned around now, their grins widening, their grumbling noises growing louder. Then, to the surprise of all four kids, they waddled toward the village at a speed just out of reach for the young People.

"Should we run after them?" Trin asked.

"We don't want them to think we're chasing them. They were smiling, right? Maybe the little one needed to get home and pee. I dunno. We know the way now. Let's just keep walking." responded Vora authoritatively.

Paz and Nikki saw no reason to contradict her. They looked at each other and shrugged.

Every few hundred feet the landscape shifted beneath them. The forest canopy was so thick it brought both the comfort of indoors and the stifling of indoors. The jade leaves and ferns of the forest floor saturated until they were nearly black. Trin still strained to look for mushrooms under every tree but it was the turn of the other three to anxiously speedwalk toward the village, dragging her by the collar whenever she became enthralled by another glob-shaped plant that "might be a mushroom."

Night was beginning to fall and the kids were beginning to feel this was perhaps the reason the Matangos had scurried off toward the village. The noises of dusk harmonized with one another, adding a new layer of sound to the already-unfamiliar drumming. Cicadas buzzed in the trees, lizards beeped in monotones, something hairy shuffled through the grasses along the path, and in the distance a pack of coyotes howled. The whining, desperate sound of the coyotes, that unmistakable brand of sound that declared a thirst for blood, was enough to scare Trin into keeping pace. Glancing over their shoulders into a darkness their eyes could hardly penetrate, already panting for breath, they began to run.

There is a moment of panic, when a Person feels a situation is unsafe, that is calmed -- at least in part -- by the act of running. Something about running feels productive, like it's solving an undeclared problem. Without losing sight of one another, this is how the four ran: solve the problem. The problem was darkness and although running didn't create light, it created space for light to appear, and that was enough. The space had to keep being created. The faster, the better. The sweat, heat, hormones, adrenalyn, and oxygen all fed this illusion. Safety came from working hard, and nothing feels more like work than running. God, how Nikki hated it.

The volume of the drumming began to drown out the sound of night. The harmony faded and the percussion had its solo. Vora wanted to tell Nikki that now she felt it in her heart, too, though her butterfly was replaced with a sinking stone of disappointment when this thought rose to the surface of her mind, since she was now confident about what he meant in the first place.

Running slowed to loping and the loping squeezed itself back into a stroll. They could see the Matangos in the distance. The scene of the party they were about to enter almost brought their legs to a complete halt. They walked in a stupor, eyes aglaze, until the young Matango ran up to greet them. She... he? Even identifying the sex of an adult Matango was nearly impossible. It looked up at them, smiling, eyes sparkling, before giggling and running back to its parents.

The family that had run off into the distance was now behind them, prodding them into the centre of the drumming circle. Each drum was hoisted by cables made of vine and seaweed the Matangos must have carried in countless loads over the course of weeks. The bottom of each timpani made of thick, curved slabs of jungle wood rested solidly on a flat, raised granite plateau. The cables stretched taught, up into the thickest branches of the trees above the perimeter of the circle. From each drum protruded a rounded shelf which held a single Matango, arms rippling with as much muscle as could be discerned on a creature which looked for all the world like a sentient mushroom. The arms effortlessly thumping the drums in near-unison, cooperating to deafen the children's ears. The four of them continued to stare upward at the massive drums as they were left in the circle alone. Skilled vibrations penetrated their chests and they would have each found it to be the most magical music they'd ever heard, if it didn't hurt quite so much.

Nikki and Paz shared a look between themselves and shared in searching beyond the torches and drums for someone they might speak to. If the terror born of the forest's harmony was a predator, chasing them always from behind their backs where they couldn't see, then the confusion created by the drums was the reverse: staring directly at the sound, they could see nothing, understand nothing.
