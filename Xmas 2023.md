## Chapter 1: For Preethi

The trees didn't disappear all at once. Losing the forest took generations and even though the Mushroom People knew the foreigners presented a danger, they rarely acted to stop them. Sometimes the foreigners wouldn't even be in the forest. On the occasions when they'd load up their sleds and drag the long corpses down the mountain and across the valley to their ships, the People would indulge in the relief of a silent forest, quickly forgetting that the silence had only returned to them temporarily.

But ultimately the trees did disappear. Unhealthy species of weak, soft trees took their place. Or bushes that barely qualified as trees at all. Or, in places, little more than grass and mud and stink. The Mushroom People relied on the trees for they provided homes for the mushrooms, the trees relied on the mushrooms for they connected the trees in vast networks, and the mushrooms relied on the people for they knew the seasons of the mushrooms and would spread spores to the farthest reaches of the forest at exactly the right times.

As Pazput sat near the edge of the cliff, she surveyed the stumps and the mud from above and pondered her People's present situation. "We can eat little else," she thought, "and even though everyone can survive on vegetables, most of us get sick if we don't have mushrooms every day."

She turned to Nikki. "Do you think we'll have to go to the caves? Will we end up eating shadow mushrooms like in the dark ages?"

Her expression looked more to Nikki like that of a Baduk player, puzzling over her next move, than one of fear. Nikki was a year older -- thirteen -- but he didn't worry about the world as Pazput did. He was either incapable of imaginging an improvement, or indifferent.

"I dunno, Paz?" he offered back. He was more concerned with the beauty of the osprey silently gliding across the blue sky beyond them.

She was tempted to launch into an exploration of available options. The diagnosis was understood. She wanted to find treatments. But she'd known Nikki since they began attending school, when he moved from a neighbouring village. She paused to give him a chance at a more intelligent response.

"How long does it take to get to the caves? Maybe we should just go eat a shadow mushroom and see if it's as bad as People say."

She was shocked by the practicality of the suggestion. The shadow mushrooms were derided by her People but it was universally understood that the shadows were edible.

"I suppose we could, right? It's a one-day journey, so we'd have to wait for the weekend. And... probably invite Trin and Vora."

"Oh. Come. On. Paz." he protested, "Trin and Vora? Are we going to need Vora's magic powers just to sleep in a cave for one night and eat some garbage?"

Pazput giggled. She knew Nikki struggled with Vora's religion. She also knew Nikki had a crush on Vora, which complicated things further. "There's no one else, Nik. The other kids are a risk -- they might tell the elders what we're doing."

"Just the two of us! We've gone weekend camping before."

"Nikki, we were kids. We haven't done that in years. You know as well as I do that no one's letting us go camping alone at this age."

"Gross, Paz. You're my sister."

"Sister from another mother, sure. But we already have to convince Mom and Dad to let us travel north, toward the caves. We don't need the burden of justifying anything else to them. They think Vora's responsible. And Trin is just a kid, so they know we won't do anything too dangerous."

"Fine," he trailed off as the osprey cut back across the sky and grabbed his attention away.

***

Back in the village, Pazput steeled herself against her first challenge: convincing Vora. She knew Trin would want to come along no matter what. Trin loved adventures with her older sister, and Vora didn't mind that Trin tagged along everywhere. After all, it says in the Scriptures to _Love thy siblings as you will love your own child. Feed her your first mushrooms and best mushrooms._

Pazput navigated her argument methodically, appealing to the Scriptures with anything she could bring herself to remember about them.

"How can you treat everyone with love and care if there is nothing to eat? If the shadows are as difficult to eat as the stories say, and we don't find a solution to the deforestation, your children will suffer the lives of ghosts here on Earth!"

"Remember that it is our duty to prepare for adulthood now, early. What better way to prepare than to begin with real problem-solving?"

"Even if we learn nothing, at least we tried! Don't the scriptures tell us _better to puzzle and puzz than to place the Baduk stone the same way as last time_?" Pazput couldn't quite remember how this sutra was spoken.

Vora had that look on her face. Quiet consideration, compassion, empathy, and judgment. Pazput found it difficult to believe she was on the receiving end of the first three.

"There isn't a prophecy..." Vora began, slowly. Pazput heard that tone of Vora's that said "I'm not convinced." She'd heard it plenty of times before, arguing for reason and research over habit and history.

"Nik will come." she interrupted. She instantly regretted it. Nikki was already uncomfortable with the situation and now she was offering him up, like crow meat to a dog. She wasn't even sure if the dog was interested.

But Vora's eyebrows gave her away. "Nikki thinks this is a good idea?" she inquired in a new tone. Not a tone that belied a crush. Neither was it sing-song or confused and nervous. It was the tone of desperation. Vora's parents were as religious as she was, perhaps more, and outside of school she rarely interacted with boys. Only with the village tetering on the precipice of famine might her parents actually allow her to go on a foraging trip for the weekend. Since they would eat the shadow mushrooms, the foraging part wasn't even a lie...right? Maybe this was okay. Her stomach burned and sank, then bounced back up into her throat.

"Sure okay," she blurted. Vora rarely lost her composure like this and the skin on Pazput's face revealed its surprise by exposing too much of the whites in her eyes. It was as if Vora was worried the offer would vaporize if she didn't accept it quickly enough.

"Great, alright! See you Saturday morning at dawn, at Nikki's hut!" Pazput blurted out, almost as quickly, because she _knew_ Vora might come to her senses and back out if she didn't conclude the transaction quickly. Vora's honour could be relied on to trump her good senses.

***

Pazput hated the sound of her name. The alliterative quality of the two "puh" sounds drove her nuts when strangers would call her by her complete name. And seeing it abbreviated to "P.P." on paper always left her with a feeling in her chest that was the internal sensation equivalent to an eye-roll in the world outside her body.

So bound up was she with her parents. They were conservative. Not like Vora's parents and their outdated ideas about boys and duty and school. But her parents were politically conservative. When the village council or the district panchayat made plans, they fell in line with the Old Ways: stay put, don't get involved with the foreigners, don't try to change things.

She loved them more than anything but she couldn't understand this. _The world is changing, whether you want to change with it or not._ she would think, as they'd discuss responses to change over dinner that she considered non-responses: hunting for mushrooms more carefully in the old locations, staying home and conserving energy so they didn't need to eat so much. She didn't want to venture far, either, but she knew that wrapping herself in the Old Ways like a blanket was suicide.

Perhaps her name was an indication that she was just different from her parents in some fundamental way. They were the only people who refused to shorten her name. And the only people from whom she didn't hate that "puh-puh" sound.

***

Dinner was the time for bringing up political issues, and a camping trip north of the village was definitely the realm of politics. Adults generally didn't walk there and they were shocked by her suggestion.

"This is a very unorthodox idea, Pazput. Tell me what you will do when you encounter the Matangos?" her father queried.

"You know as well as I do that the Matangos are harmless, Dad. They might look like mushrooms but they know we mean them no harm. And they don't have any issues with us eating the fruit of the real mycillium under the trees. They aren't family."

Chichioya was taken aback by his daughter's confidence. She was always a rational person, but she normally didn't confront the family with her rationality over a steaming plate of mushroom.

He paused to think but words didn't come. He glanced over at Paz's mother, but Hahaoya's arguments had already been exhausted by her husband. Their cautious nature wasn't backed up by argument, since they rarely had to argue a position the entire village already agreed with.

Kannala, Paz's grandmother, swallowed a small cube of mushroom fried in mustard oil. The foreigners had told her this preparation tasted like fish but she did not know what a fish tasted like and had no intention of finding out.

"Let the child go, Chichi. It's just two days and maybe she'll even find some nice mushrooms to share with us."

Looking at Paz as she said this, Kannala smiled the smile of grandmothers. The smile that all at once conveys infinite love, decades of wisdom, and an authority that no one at the dinner table would dare challenge.

In an instant, the matter was settled and Kannala returned to her simulated fish as if nothing had transpired.

***

Paz, Nikki, Trin, and Vora walked in a line through the forest. From the osprey's vantage point, they were the tiniest army of ants. Too few in number to survive on their own.

The osprey imagined swooping down and picking them up, like rats or fish. If the People were small enough, would they be best scooped up by the neck? They don't have tails. Or, if they do, their tails seem to small to act as a handle, with which to carry them into the sky. Which is a shame because if you want to smash food on the rocks, it's best to turn it around so the head smashes first. Maybe grab them by the leg? But they have thick legs, for such little People. Oh? The tiny ants vanished into the bush already.

None of them felt small. They felt brave. Trin's bravery came from the company of her older sister. Vora's bravery came from her faith in the Gods. Paz and Nikki's bravery came from their experience. This wasn't their first time deep into the woods -- but it was their first time with their parents' permission.

"How long until we see a Matango?" asked Trin for the umpteenth time.

"We might not see any Mantangos," sighed Paz, tired of providing complete answers. She was suddenly glad she was an only child. Nikki was all the sibling she needed.

Trin sagged. Suddenly her older friends began to feel like stand-ins for her parents. Not nearly so religious, but nearly as boring. At least her parents played exciting music during the fire and the sacrifice. She loved the chanting. Mentally, she began one of the mantras she was so accustomed to performing with her family but before she could finish one stanza, the dull feeling Paz left her with had lifted. The mantra hadn't done it. Eyes did.

"Did you see THAT?!" she exclaimed. She flopped to one side of the path to get a better look at the eyes which had peered around a thick and gnarled birch tree. This time it was Vora's turn to throw cold water on Trin. She grabbed her by the collar and yanked her back onto the path.

"Yes, idiot. We saw it. And we'd like to see it again, so please don't terrify the Matango with your shouting?"

Trin pouted for a moment but she was too wired to feign hurt feelings. She'd never seen anything quite like it. The mushroom creature wasn't terrified at all and slid its muffin top head back around the tree again, eyes bulging. One pudgy foot made its way onto the path. Then another. Paz couldn't tell for sure, but it seemed to be a child? Maybe even a toddler.

Two older Matangos appeared behind the small one. The smaller of the three was obviously a child... but the toddling appeared to be a property of all Matangos. They waddled like penguins but Paz guessed these fat little marshmallows wouldn't compensate for immobility on land with graceful swimming. Despite their waddling, the Matangos managed to surround them. Not a threatening gesture. More like a collective hug. The Matangos smiled and grumbled, pointing toward their village.

Of the four of them, Nikki was the only one who hesitated as they walked deeper into the woods than they had ever gone, toward the caves.

"How can we be sure we can trust these guys? Sure, they're cute... but so is a river otter. Have you ever seen an otter shred a fish with those little triangle razors in its mouth? Terrifying."

But even Nikki couldn't resist the sound of the drums. They'd all heard the stories of the Matangos' incessant music. But as they approached the caves from the south, the drumming was otherworldly, as if the forest itself was drumming. The fast-paced drum beat was everywhere, all at once, even though they could tell they still had hours of walking before they'd reach the village and hear it at full volume.

***

As they approached the village, the drums welcomed them. Loud, throbbing beats were the soundtrack of the jungle. Paz hadn't been this deep in the jungle before, even on her most irresponsible days. The trees grew taller near the caves, their foliage producing a permanent cloud of darkness across everything. It was a surprise to Paz and Nikki just how many trees were left this far north and this far into the hills... though they both knew these trees would be food for the foreigners' machines next. There were no mushrooms at the feet of the trees yet.

The darkness and the drumming had a symmetry. As the darkness enveloped everything on the forest floor, the drumming hugged their chests. "I can feel this in my heart," whispered Nikki to Vora. She was confused by his meaning, and a butterfly somehow managed to squeeze into her bellybutton, fly around her stomach, and settle in her throat.

The Matangos who led the way toward the village turned around now, their grins widening, their grumbling noises growing louder. Then, to the surprise of all four kids, they waddled toward the village at a speed just out of reach for the young People.

"Should we run after them?" Trin asked.

"We don't want them to think we're chasing them. They were smiling, right? Maybe the little one needed to get home and pee. I dunno. We know the way now. Let's just keep walking." responded Vora authoritatively.

Paz and Nikki saw no reason to contradict her. They looked at each other and shrugged.

Every few hundred feet the landscape shifted beneath them. The forest canopy was so thick it brought both the comfort of indoors and the stifling of indoors. The jade leaves and ferns of the forest floor saturated until they were nearly black. Trin still strained to look for mushrooms under every tree but it was the turn of the other three to anxiously speedwalk toward the village, dragging her by the collar whenever she became enthralled by another glob-shaped plant that "might be a mushroom."

Night was beginning to fall and the kids were beginning to feel this was perhaps the reason the Matangos had scurried off toward the village. The noises of dusk harmonized with one another, adding a new layer of sound to the already-unfamiliar drumming. Cicadas buzzed in the trees, lizards beeped in monotones, something hairy shuffled through the grasses along the path, and in the distance a pack of coyotes howled. The whining, desperate sound of the coyotes, that unmistakable brand of sound that declared a thirst for blood, was enough to scare Trin into keeping pace. Glancing over their shoulders into a darkness their eyes could hardly penetrate, already panting for breath, they began to run.

There is a moment of panic, when a Person feels a situation is unsafe, that is calmed -- at least in part -- by the act of running. Something about running feels productive, like it's solving an undeclared problem. Without losing sight of one another, this is how the four ran: solve the problem. The problem was darkness and although running didn't create light, it created space for light to appear, and that was enough. The space had to keep being created. The faster, the better. The sweat, heat, hormones, adrenalyn, and oxygen all fed this illusion. Safety came from working hard, and nothing feels more like work than running. God, how Nikki hated it.

---

The volume of the drumming began to drown out the sound of night. The harmony faded and the percussion had its solo. Vora wanted to tell Nikki that now she felt it in her heart, too, though her butterfly was replaced with a sinking stone of disappointment when this thought rose to the surface of her mind, since she was now confident about what he meant in the first place.

Running slowed to loping and the loping squeezed itself back into a stroll. They could see the Matangos in the distance. The scene of the party they were about to enter almost brought their legs to a complete halt. They walked in a stupor, eyes aglaze, until the young Matango ran up to greet them. She... he? Even identifying the sex of an adult Matango was nearly impossible. Children more so. It looked up at them, smiling, eyes sparkling, before giggling and running back to its parents.

The family that had run off into the distance was now behind them, prodding them into the centre of the drumming circle. Each drum was hoisted by cables made of vine and seaweed the Matangos must have carried in countless loads over the course of weeks. The bottom of each timpani made of thick, curved slabs of jungle wood rested solidly on a flat, raised granite plateau. The cables stretched taught, up into the thickest branches of the trees above the perimeter of the circle. From each drum protruded a rounded shelf which held a single Matango, arms rippling with as much muscle as could be discerned on a creature which looked for all the world like a sentient mushroom. The arms effortlessly thumping the drums in near-unison, cooperating to deafen the children's ears. The four of them continued to stare upward at the massive drums as they were left in the circle alone. Skilled vibrations penetrated their chests and they would have each found it to be the most magical music they'd ever heard, if it didn't hurt quite so much.

Nikki and Paz shared a look before searching beyond the torches and drums for someone they might speak to. If the terror born of the forest's harmony was a predator, chasing them always from behind their backs where they couldn't see, then the confusion created by the drums was the reverse: staring directly at the sound, they could see nothing, understand nothing.

As they strained their stupefied eyes against the pandemonium around them, the timpanis reached a crescendo and stopped in unison. The sudden silence felt to their bodies like diving into an ice lake after the first thaws of spring, then running out into the sunshine. The drums deepest vibrations still throbbed inside them, turning their torsos into gongs. The thinnest vibrations shook along the surface of their skin. It would take minutes of silence for the effects of the drums to wear off on them but they didn't have that much time, since the chief of the Matangos was already walking toward them through the torch light.

"Welcome!" His voice was deeper and more familiar than Paz expected. Grandfatherly. "You young People sure have traveled a long way from your home. Ronny and Kathy were shocked to see you in the forest... but they only speak Matangu so they had to do their best to encourage you to come here, without scaring you. We were very worried you wouldn't come! The forest is quite safe, especially for a pack of four beings, though it doesn't always feel that way."

"Thank you so much!" Trin was blurting her words, overcome by the new sensations of the day. At 9, she'd never so much as drank a glass of tea, much less surrounded herself with deafening music. She surprised herself by being the first to speak, then felt obligated to continue what she'd began. "We really were freaked out about the forest. We could hear coyotes and it was getting so dark. Thank you for lighting your village and for providing the drums to guide us!"

"Oh... this?" The chief looked around. "This is, ehhh, an every-night kind of thing. Matango life revolves around music. But we're glad you like it. We actually prepared something else for you... we've heard through the forest that your People are struggling to find food these days. Is that true?"

"Yes." Trin couldn't look him in the eyes even though her reply was saturated in honesty. She knew where this conversation was headed and no longer wanted to be the one spearheading their side of it.

"We have a wonderful cook. What all things do you People eat?"

***

Trin grimaced. "We eat... lots of stuff. But. Uhm. Mushrooms, mostly." She clenched up, waiting for a wail of grief or a frown of disappointment.

Instead, the chief winked at her and settled even further into his comforting, elderly figure. "I thought so," he smiled. Lucky, too, since that's what we've fried up for you!

"I know, I know... we look like mushrooms. But we're really not related at all. We're boring old mammals, just like you folks. Granted, not so hairy. Just a biological coincidence. Other than occasionally fighting off some overzealous deer, the similarity doesn't usually affect us."

Four smiling matangos strutted out in line with the chief, presenting each of the kids with a plate of fried mushrooms. Vora and Trin's parents made them say a prayer of gratitude before every meal, followed by a silent waiting period of ten minutes intended to express compassion for those less fortunate, who could not find or afford mushrooms. In actuality, this waiting period was a way of preventing the girls from scalding their lips since, much to their parents' dismay, they tended to resemble carrot-starved horses when they actually did begin to eat. As a result, Vora and Trin managed stoic facial expressions, if only for a minute.

Paz and Nikki did not.

Their eyes bulging, they instantly shifted their gaze questioningly to the chief, who turned his palms up to face them and invite them to eat. They each sat down cross-legged and began to lift steaming, crispy mushrooms to their face.

Trin, not wanting to miss a minute of mushroom consumption, sat down beside them. Vora sighed, shrugged, and fell in line. Her mother wasn't here to witness her and, besides, who's to say that patiently waiting to begin was good manners in the Matango village? It sure seemed like the Matangos wanted them to eat their fill.

"I should warn you," interrupted the chief, "that these are cave mushrooms. There aren't many tree shrooms at this time of year or in this part of the forest. And since the foreigners arrived, they've been harder and harder to find, anyway."

All four mouths hung open, eyes wide, staring up at the chief. "Cave mushrooms?" offered Nikki. "But... they taste like regular mushrooms! They're not dirty. They're great!"

"Well, yes." The chief hesitated. "But... your stomachs won't be used to them. Please eat as much as you like... I know your People can eat cave mushrooms... but take your time? Avoid ill effects."

Nikki didn't need further encouragement. He was already focused back on his plate, lifting the hot mushrooms into his mouth, one by one. The girls were less eager. None of them wanted to offend the Matangos by not eating but their appetites had suddenly waned.

Tea was served, and some light vegetables on the sides: carrots, beans, broccoli, sweet potato, and a brightly-coloured cabbage. All healthy plants the Matangos knew the People could eat. Nikki continued to gorge exclusively on the mushrooms.

Until he stopped to sing.

***

Nikki's singing took everyone off-guard, the Matangos most of all. "Oh! A singer! Drummers: support!" shouted the chief, grinning widely enough to show teeth. The girls all shared a simultaneous thought, surprised to find out the Matangos had teeth, then ashamed for assuming they didn't.

The drums began to roll gently as the drummers picked up on Nikki's harmony. "Sweet, cool caaaaave... how ye brought these shrooms to me. Sweet, cool caaaaave! How ye saved a fool like me!"

Vora was shocked to find Nikki singing in the tune of a hymn. She found herself vacillating between her butterfly and a fear that perhaps what he was singing was blasphemous. Her worries didn't last, as Nikki's performance didn't remain constant. As his rhythm changed, the drums quickly kept pace. _Thump Pa-thump, Thump Pa-thump - Thumpthumpthumpthump, Pa-thumpthump_

> 13
> From *knot*weed to *rock*weed, walk the forest to the beach.
> Travel with*out* steed, search the caves and find your peace.
> Do we *not* bleed? Foreigners decimate every leaf!
> When will we *be* freed? We're dying for relief!
> Forests with*out* trees are dairy cows without beef.
> Are flowers without bees. Are babies without teeth.
> Who bring the 'shroom, who will guide our people?
> Those with nothing to prove, with canopy for steeple.

With that, he raised his hand with a flourish and bent over softly like a snow-heavy tree in front of the chief. The drums sounded the triumphant end of his rhymes with a rolling crescendo that throbbed to its conclusion with the penetrating sound of war drums. The matangos clapped and cheered, but Paz could see in Nikki's eyes that something had risen up inside him. Maybe... vomit? She was terrified he was going to puke all over the chief. As a result, she struggled to eat anything else while watching over him to ensure that he didn't. To her relief, the meal concluded peacefully.

***

After the meal was finished, the matangos had all shaken the kids' hands, and they'd been shown to their room, Paz had a closer look at Nikki.

"Nik, are you okay?"

His eyes were almost glassy with wide pupils and what looked to be a grey fog just behind the lenses. He didn't acknowledge her question directly, but she could hear him still singing and muttering under his breath.

"Come take a look at him... I'm worried he's sick." she pleaded with Vora and Trin.

Vora looked deeply and directly into Nikki's eyes, studying them as she might study the mycelium of a mushroom species in her Biology class.

"The fog is _moving_, Paz. I'm not sure what's going on with him. Is he poisoned? The cave mushrooms aren't supposed to be poisonous."

As Vora observed Nikki, Paz watched Vora. She noticed that Vora's eyes had a hint of the same glassy look. Paz leaned in, and could see tiny swirls of grey smoke in Vora's eyes.

"Vora, I think we're all poisoned. It's in your eyes too. Just not as much."

Vora considered this. "But I feel fine. I feel the best I've felt in a while, actually. I'm just not singing and rapping like a crazy person."

"We didn't eat very much," offered Trin. "We need to go back home tomorrow, and Nikki's the only one of us who really knows what the mushrooms do."

"Indeed, I know." Nikki's sudden vocalization startled Vora, who fell backward onto the dirt floor. "I see so much. I know so much. The mushrooms are not poison. They are medicine."

"Nik, you're scaring me." Paz moved beside Vora, to comfort her and to address him directly. But it was almost as though he couldn't even see her. Those glassy eyes were looking through her, to some far off place outside their cave.

Paz turned to Vora. "I have to eat more, to know what they do."

"Paz, don't... we don't need two crazy, singing weirdos on the long walk back to the village." Vora crossed her arms and arched an eyebrow, her mother's signature warning.

"I won't be - not if I eat them tonight." Paz insisted. "Vora, you have to get us home tomorrow, no matter what condition we're in. But I need to know what Nikki knows."

Paz stood and strode out of the cave without providing a gap for Vora to interject. When she returned, she had two bowls of different sizes between her hands, one upside-down on top of the other, forming a clamshell.

"This doesn't seem wise, Paz." Vora protested one final time.

Paz put her hand up. "If you think I've had to many, take them away from me. But not until then."

Paz began to eat the mushrooms, carefully, methodically. She paid attention to the feelings inside her body: her heart, her breathing, the blood flowing in her veins to the extent that she could feel it. One mushroom. Two mushrooms. A third. A fourth. She didn't pause except to sip tea and take a breath.

After a dozen mushrooms, she began to feel something. But it wasn't the feeling of being poisoned. She'd eaten plenty of bad mushrooms before: Amanita Muscaria, False Parasols, Little Browns, and even a bite of a Death Cap once. Her lips weren't numb. She didn't feel like she needed to vomit. Her muscles weren't clenching up. She actually felt relaxed, warm, and even a bit cozy.

But as she leaned into that cozy feeling she found herself leaning into her seat. It was as if the chair was swallowing her. She straightened up, tried to settle her nerves by taking a deep breath, then asked Vora in her calmest voice: "Is the chair eating me?" Vora opened her mouth to respond but the sound produced was that of an irritable duck. "What?" asked Paz but the only response was honking and quacking. Still, Vora was at least smiling, which meant things couldn't be all bad. The chair probably isn't eating me, she thought. Not even sure if Vora could hear her --- or if she was really speaking aloud at all --- she looked into Vora's eyes which were now spinning discs full of colour and light and said, "I'm going to see how far this goes. Nikki had more than twelve mushrooms."

Paz began to repeat her methodical consumption of cave mushrooms, but she lost track of how many she'd consumed. Her head was foggy and she couldn't seem to escape the word "twelfth". Twelve. Twelfth. Twelphfth. Twuh. Twelfth. -lfth. -uhlfth. What in the name of spruce tip tea was wrong with that word? Paz put her hands to her lips but the mushroom she'd pinced between her thumb and three foremost fingers like a crab strangling an oyster seemed to have vapourized. She looked up to see Vora taking her mushroom bowl away, though Vora's arms were now wobbling tentacles. Her head was an arrow pointed to the ceiling, the gelatinous head of a squid. Paz looked over at Trin. Trin was also a bobbling squid.

"I've probably had enough anyway" she said to the cave full of squids. Or to herself. She wasn't sure.

***

The night was long and restless. With time, Vora, Trin, and Nikki all returned to their normal human forms. But as her companions fell asleep beside her, Paz didn't feel any relief from the effects of the mushroom. She found herself thinking about her mother and father --- just how much she loved them, how much she wanted them to be happy. Why don't I tell them how much I love them more often? What if they died tomorrow? Images of death filled her mind. Not the dark and gruesome spectre associated with graveyards and rot. Death as transition, as metamorphosis, as matriculation.

She began to witness the machinery of the universe. Death, it would appear, was little more than a shift change. Maybe you were a fisherman in one life, a princess in the next, a tree in the life that followed that. Put down your net, pick up a sceptre. Put down the sceptre, spent 700 years growing into a network of your peers beneath the ground and ultimately claiming the title of Mother Tree before becoming building material for those tall, pink, and hairy folk who seemed to want nothing more than for every tree to fall to their machines.

The machines of humankind have a lifespan, too. They are cast in iron alloys, tempered, carved, bolted, and welded. An infant machine is born wholesale; it doesn't have a fragile early phase like a baby bird that cannot fly or a sapling that a deer might chomp into oblivion with a single bite. Instead, they are assembled. The parts have phases: rock like tiny mountains, ore separated from the unwanted filth, molten caramel in the crucible, forged into blades and bolts, tempered into invincible tissues and organs for an invincible creature. Or so it would seem.

The death of the machine is far more romantic, far more natural. Throughout its life, the owners will replace certain organs, fluids, limbs. But eventually this burden of the beast will outlive its utility. Once a beast is no longer incessantly loved and cared for, the process of decay begins. The fluids dry up. The limbs seize. Connective tissue becomes loose and rattles. The threads of bolts begin to fray, ligaments snap, joints become arthritic and burn. The heat of
