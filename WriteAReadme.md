1. how - existing
2. what - audits => documentation => deployment => automation
3. why - “deployment-first” will save your consumers tons of grief later because then nothing is accidentally taken for granted
4. who - ostensibly (new) devs who don’t already think of all this as common knowledge … but really senior people: the people with the deploy keys, passwords, and aws credentials. if you control these, it’s your job to help the newer folks through this process. (a) show them this document and (b) give them the tools and processes they need to execute the “how”
