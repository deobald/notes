# Crux- Capture The Truth

_Bitemporal Time_, _Graph Relationships_, and _Immutable Data_ constitute implicit truths about all data models.

## bitemporal time 

...is not a luxury, it is simply the truth about the two timelines which are inherent in the creation of a computerized system: (1) that of external reality (2) that of the computer

## graphs

...exist whether you want them to or not. An author who references a concept written about by another author is creating a relationship between herself, the other author, and that concept.

- ex. Yuval Noah Harari writing about Mark Zuckerberg creates a relationship not only between two humans but between Harari's book and Facebook (both the software and the company)
- Alexander: "a city is not a tree"

## immutability

...is the only way to express truth. We must acknowledge that we only know what we knew when we knew it. There is no path to perfect truth but to admit imperfect knowledge along the way.

## eviction

...is not a luxury because "the truth" can be a weapon. Fact: _Steven Deobald used Facebook on January 21st, 2021._ becomes a weapon if my name, my behaviour, or that date form a component part of weaponized data against me (or anyone else).

As even the most mundane databases become increasingly personal, we are likely to see privacy emerge as a fundamental human right. Governments and corporations will need the capacity to _evict the truth_ as a matter of essential human rights. This is not incongruous with _capturing the truth_ as one cannot evict a fact which has not been accurately specified.
