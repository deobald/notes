# Crux- Capture The Truth

_Bitemporal Time_, _Graph Relationships_, and _Immutable Data_ constitute implicit truths about all data models.

- [ ] Are there any CS proofs to this effect? -sd

- "What is true?" dimension: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua4QMFQATco&t=299s (CGP Grey)

- truth in: time, data, form, code

## bitemporal time 

...is not a luxury, it is simply the truth about the two timelines which are inherent in the creation of a computerized system: (1) that of external reality (2) that of the computer

## graphs

...exist whether you want them to or not. An author who references a concept written about by another author is creating a relationship between herself, the other author, and that concept.

- ex. Yuval Noah Harari writing about Mark Zuckerberg creates a relationship not only between two humans but between Harari's book and Facebook (both the software and the company)
- Alexander: "a city is not a tree"

## immutability

...is the only way to express truth. We must acknowledge that we only know what we knew when we knew it. There is no path to perfect truth but to admit imperfect knowledge along the way.

## eviction

...is not a luxury because "the truth" can be a weapon. Fact: _Steven Deobald used Facebook on January 21st, 2021._ becomes a weapon if my name, my behaviour, or that date form a component part of weaponized data against me (or anyone else).

As even the most mundane databases become increasingly personal, we are likely to see privacy emerge as a fundamental human right. Governments and corporations will need the capacity to _evict the truth_ as a matter of essential human rights. This is not incongruous with _capturing the truth_ as one cannot evict a fact which has not been accurately specified.

## Draft

### Your first taste of truth

They promised a Universal Truth. Once again you sit down -- legs crossed, back straight -- and close your eyes. For days you drag your attention away from distractions, toward your breath. After so many days of work, this breath feels delicate and serene. You want nothing more than to stay with this tranquil breath, the sway of a breeze in the grass under your nostrils, but the distractions continue to tempt you.

The most violent distractions are meta-cognitive. You imagine your own mind as a rabid wolf, gnashing his teeth inches from dead rabbits and elk scattered in a wide circumference just beyond the radius of his chain. The chain leads back to a thick fence post driven deep into the ground at the focus of the circle. As your mind quiets, the wolf lies down by the fence post. He doesn't open his mouth. He doesn't get up. He is domesticated but not sedated. His eyes close as yours did the first day you got here. Suddenly you realize you are distracted again, thinking of the wolf. Your attention returns to your breath.

The wolf is not real. The wolf is not real because the objects of mind are not real. Imagination is not real. _Thoughts_ are not real. They are real for utilitarian purposes, of course. You are not meditating for utility. You are meditating for Truth. You are distracted again. Back to the breath.

A week has passed since the bus dropped you off at the gate of the meditation center. Truth begins to surface. It is nothing like you had anticipated. Some truths are painful, others euphoric, but they are all novel. As you lance your mind and body with your unabating attention to observe every infinitesimal change within them, truth -- subtle, pure, immediate -- smashes into every particle of your being. You watch the birth of the universe as directed by the axiomatic Universal Laws which precede it. Time is visible to you as a moebius strip. It stops, splinters, then shatters into ineffable shards. You feel yourself grow to suffuse the universe across all space and time knowing that only this could possibly be the Truth, the one unteachable Universal Truth, and that _you are it._ Molecular clouds the smell of cotton candy begin to take shape inside you, a garden of stellar nurseries which give birth to a tremor of galaxies all dancing and collapsing in on one another and spilling from your fingertips until-- the gong goes off. It's time for breakfast.

You are tasting porridge and tea for the first time. Your eyes are open but you can still feel your cardiovascular system shudder at an injection of glucose. This is not the perfect, universal truth of deep meditation but there is something true about this breakfast. This is truth at the level of science -- atoms and energy, biology and physics. The sublime begins to fade and you promise yourself you will write about what you have learned even as your thoughts drift back to your life in the office. You imagine standing at the whiteboard, squeaking out a dry erase data model for temporal backfill and speculative events.

### Subtlety onion

Back at your desk, you try to explain "truth" to Patrick. It comes in layers. The innermost layer and the outermost layer are _laws_. The inner laws are those which bind fundamental, universal truth. These are the laws we tend to obliquely refer to when discussing the concept of "truth", despite the fact that there is no accurate way to speak of them at all. They are not the laws of the worlds religious sects, nor the laws of humanity's scientific curiosities. They do not discount scientific law, of course. Thermodynamics are not subjective. But the laws which form the foundation of the universe can only be learned by experiencing them directly. These laws are the only objective truth. They are the subtlest truth. This truth is fixed and eternal.

The laws in the outermost layer are very different. They are the laws of society -- whether express or implied, encoded or assumed.
